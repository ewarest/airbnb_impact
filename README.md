## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

As a frequent traveller and Airbnb customer I was looking for a critical view on the impacts the platform has for cities and their residents. Also this analysis and the blogpost on Medium are part of my Udacity Data Science Nanodegree program.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The python code can be found in a Jupyter Notebook. The analysis process is documented with Markdown cells, comments and docstrings.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post availableÂ here.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Thanks to insidedairbnb.com for providing latest data on Airbnb listings. The analysis was done with data released in September 2019.
